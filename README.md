# T1 Template App
A template app for the T1 School Project.

The Template provides some Widgets to make the development for the T1 app more accesible and easier  
For more advanced Features please refer to the Flutter Documentation  

If you're new to Flutter, here is [a handy tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)

## Usage

Wifi Support Tested:
- Linux
- Windows
- Chrome

Wifi Support Potentialy:
- Android
- MacOS
- iOS

Bluetooth Support:
- Android

Bluetooth works over the Serial Interface of the ESP32, currently the only implementation works on Android.  
BLE Support may come in the Future for multiple Systems

If You want to use the Bluetooth Version and implement it in your own project, dont forget to adjust your AndroidManifest.xml according to the one in this Template.  
If not done properly the App wont work on Android and you will only get an error. The easiest Way is to fork this Repo :)
